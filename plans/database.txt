##### Materials #####


movement_statuses:

material_types:
    attributes:
        - name
        - code
    relationships:
        - materials: has many materials


materials:
    attributes:
        - uuid
        - material_number (sap psam_part_number)
        - part_number (bapm_part_number)
        - description
        - base_qty
        - base_unit_of_measure
        - material_type_id
    relationships:
        - material_containers: has many containers

material_container_types:
    attributes:
        - name
    relationships:
        - material_containers: has many containers


material_containers:
    attributes:
        - material_uuid
        - material_container_type_id
        - barcode
        - quantity

        - storage_location_uuid
            reason:
                can keep this here because it is always a 'to one' relationship
                from the container side of things.

                have to think of the best way to assume that this matches up
                a container history record kept somewhere else though.

        - quality_status_id
            reason:
                can handle various quality states that prevent/allow movement
                    quarantine (locked)
                    restricted (mrb)
                    released stock (free to move)
                    inspection hold (receiving or sort)
                    quality check (sort)
                    scrap
                    concession (irm stock that passed quality retest)


    computed:
        lot_number (derived from barcode)
        expiration data (derived from barcode maybe?)
        skid_id (sha1 hash of trimmed barcode)
        employee (label print employee)


    relationships:
        - material: has one material
        - barcode: has many barcodes
            reason: skid could lose initial barcode
                    and keep track with new one
        - material_container_types: has one type

        - machine_uuid (nullable)
        - storage_location_uuid (nullable)
        - status_id
        - teammate_id (nullable maybe?)
            reason:
                not sure if should always require a teammate to
                maybe should be handled at event level and not material request data point?
