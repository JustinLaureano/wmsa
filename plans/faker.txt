    get last timestamp of previous record
        while the diff in time between previous record and now() is greater than the max time gap allowed
            run faker creator logic (make = true)

    faker creator logic
        random odds to make/create || make if set to true

        create odds on how many to make
        make record(s)

        remove same amount of oldest records as created

    make material requests - done

    allot skids for requests - done

    move skids for requests - done
        determine lottery odds to make movement - done

    skid movements
        simulate new skids being put on racks
            needs alloted records for this
        simulate skids being moved from rack to rack
        simulate some skids moving to out/ship locations and leaving inventory

        create skid location history records for these
