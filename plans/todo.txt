legacy environment
    wms database
    pics database
        for material requests from presses initially, but eventually prod data

    legacy-data-faker
        small laravel app to simply run jobs every so often to create fake data in legacy db
            - skids
            - material requests
            - etc

    legacy-data-importer
        running laravel commands that will import new data from legacy wms db to the new db
        this will keep them in sync so a hard cutover will not be required, but can be gradual

        have to be careful that imports do not fire any sap transactions


sap-data-mocker
    create a simple application to generate document records that come from SAP.
        delivery documents
        material documents
