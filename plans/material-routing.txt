# Steps

- Create a material
- Create a routing for that material
- routing gets saved as a template
- template id gets assigned to the material
- now routing template can be reused on other materials

## usage in app

- Skid container gets created
    - fetch routing for this part
    - assign routing to this skid container
        - this is where appendages for sort would happen
    - set current step in routing process index to 0



## What does routing designer look like

- allow user to select material
- allow user to select and sort order of locations that material needs to go to


## new routing logic (wip)

have initial starting building id that scan was made from

check current building for routing rules

see if any movements have been made for that starting building id

if so
    get all movements for that starting building id

    get the full sequence of movements needed

    determine current sequence position

    for each step in next sequence,
        determine if a building transfer is needed
        if so,
            place transfer steps in between

    get all available locations for the next sequence


if not

    determine if any routing rules exist for current building
    if so
        get the full sequence of movements needed
    if not
        determine if any routing rules exist for other buildings
        if so
            get all available locations for the next sequence
        if not
            return null



put away logic
    user selects put away screen





### Current Logic Flow in Legacy WMS ###

- Is degas part && needs degassed
    - send to degas

- Is Thailand part
    Repack/Sort/Completion/FG(or TOY) flow

- If has open request without allocation
    send to request location (as long as location is not shipping dock)

- If Toyota Tote Item
    - Items 806875, 806885
    - Send to Completion if hasnt been
    - Determine tote type to find out if it needs to go to TOY or FG

- If MBDS Part Number
    - Follow Completion/Defiance Building/MBDS flow

- If 807066 part number
    - Follow Defiance Out/Blackhawk In/Sort/Completion/FG flow
    - Note: This should already flow correctly in new routing logic

- If already in a rack location
    - Check if it needs to stay in same location

    - If current location is Building 1 Completion
        - Send to Blackhawk

- If Scan is in Defiance Building
    - Put away in defiance locations

- Find put away area for building
    - If no area found for building, return message to user

- If putaway area a FG location
    - Check if needs to go to Completion

If area is an assigned FG location (FG-******)
    - send to appropriate assigned location

- If putaway area is Completion
    - If part number is 805795 and has qty < 305
        - Needs to be routed to empty service part location

    - Check if has unique post sort location
        - If has post sort location
            - Update putaway area value to that location
        
        - If the post sort location is MBDS Out
            - Change building lookup to Defiance building 

    - If none of the above, return Completion Station

- If putaway area is Sort
    - Check if has been sorted
        - If sorted
            - Check if has been completed
                - If Completed
                    - Look for unique post sort location if building 1
                    - If building 2, check if toyota part
                    - If is toyota part
                        - Return toyota workstation location
                - If Not completed
                    - Check parts that do not need to be sorted
                    - If needs to be Completed
                        - Check for unique post sort location
                            If so, return new putaway area

                        - Return completion station
        - If not sorted
            - Return sort location

- If putaway location is Toy
    - Check if it has been completed yet
        If not completed
            - Return completion station
        If completed
            - Return toyota putaway location

- If putaway area is receiving dock
    - return receiving dock location

- If putaway area is Phosphate
    - return phosphate putaway location

- If putaway area is Aluminum
    - return aluminum putaway location

- If putaway area is purged trailer location
    - Return purged trailer location

- If putaway area is cured trailer location
    - Return cured trailer location

- If putaway area is applied zone location
    - Return applied zone location

- If putaway area is Repack 2 location
    - Return Repack 2 location

- If putaway area is BHWH location type
    - Return empty BHWR putaway location

- If putaway area is flowrack
    - get skid limit for flow rack type

    - If item is 300820
        - Determine if dented tote type
            - If so, Append letter D to item number

    - Use item number to find valid flow rack locations
        - for each flow rack location
            - If has empty spaces
                - Return flow rack location

- Determine any excluded locations to search for if is service part

- If no location has been found yet,
    - Search for empty rack location by part and building area

- If still no location
    - Return message to user

- Allocate suitable location

- Return location to user
