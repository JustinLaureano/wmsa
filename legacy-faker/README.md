# Legacy Faker

This application will seed fake data to the legacy database via scheduled jobs that run at various intervals.

The goal is to keep the legacy database updated continuously so that the data importer routines can run in unison. This is necessary to ensure that a smooth, gradual transition can occur between the legacy database and application to the new one.
