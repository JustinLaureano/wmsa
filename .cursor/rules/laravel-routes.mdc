Routes defined in laravel should always call single invokable functions as the route action.

Route definitions should be stored in the appropriate core/routes/web and core/routes/api directories for each specific domain.

All routes should be named following the dot syntax.

Auth routes should be grouped if possible, and any public routes should be defined seperately.

Route example:

`core/routes/web/irm.php`
```php
<?php

use App\Http\Controllers\Irm\ViewChemicals;
use App\Http\Controllers\Irm\GetIrmInventory;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('irm/chemicals/inventory', GetIrmInventory::class)
    ->name('irm.chemicals.inventory');

Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('irm/chemicals', ViewChemicals::class)
        ->name('irm.chemicals');
});


```
